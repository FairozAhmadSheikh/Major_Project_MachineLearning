# PROJECT INFORMATION
Diamond Price Prediction
Our Goal here is to Predict Price of a Given Diamond (Regression Analysis)

In our Dataset there are 10 independent Features (Including Id )

1 id      : unique identifier of each diamond
2 carat   : carat(ct) unique unit of weight measurment used to measure gemstones and diamonds
3 cut     : quality of diamond cut 
4 color   : color of the diamond
5 clarity : Diamond Clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone ,graded to the     visibility of these characteristics, under 10 power magnification
6 depth   : The Depth of diamond is its height (in milimeters) measured from the culet(bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface)
7 table : A diamonds table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up
8 x: Diamonds X dimension
9 y: Diamonds Y dimension
10 z: Diamonds Z dimension
